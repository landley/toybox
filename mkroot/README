mkroot - simple linux system builder

Compiles a toybox-based root filesystem and kernel that can boot under qemu.

Prebuilt binaries available from http://landley.net/bin/mkroot/latest
launched via ./run-qemu.sh (which assumes you have QEMU installed, KVM
works in a pinch), and then run "exit" to shut down the emulated system.

This project is a successor to https://landley.net/aboriginal/about.html
and shares most of the same goals, with a much simpler implementation.

--- Quick Start

To install the build prerequisites: download toybox source, linux kernel source,
and one or more musl cross compiler toolchain(s) in the "ccc" directory:

  $ cd toybox
  $ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux
  $ wget https://landley.net/bin/toolchains/latest/i686-linux-musl-cross.tar.xz
  $ mkdir ccc
  $ tar xvJCf ccc i686-linux-musl-cross.tar.xz

Then invoke mkroot like:

  $ mkroot/mkroot.sh CROSS=i686 LINUX=linux
  $ root/i686/run-qemu.sh

This project is a successor to https://landley.net/aboriginal/about.html
and shares most of the same goals, with a much simpler implementation.

--- Building without a cross compiler (warning: glibc sucks)

Running ./mkroot.sh with no arguments and no $CROSS_COMPILE environment
variable builds a statically linked root filesystem with the host's compiler.

  $ mkroot/mkroot.sh

You can then chroot into it like this:

  $ sudo chroot output/host/root /init
    $ ls -l
    $ exit

Unfortunately, glibc doesn't properly support static linking, so if your host
Linux uses glibc the build will spit out a bunch of warnings indicating
all sorts of glibc features won't work (DNS lookups always fail, ls -l can't
read names out of /etc/password, etc). This is a known problem with glibc,
because ex-maintainer Ulrich Drepper had a strong personal dislike of static
linking and actively sabotaged it.

If building on a non-glibc system, such as Alpine Linux, you're fine.
Otherwise, you'll probably want to cross compile with a musl-libc toolchain
to avoid glibc's very long list of static linking bugs. (The resulting root
filesystem is also significantly smaller: a stripped statically linked
"hello world" binary for x86-64 is 5420 bytes with musl-libc, and 682,696 bytes
with glibc.)</p>

--- Building with a cross compiler.

The variable $CROSS_COMPILE indicates the toolchain prefix to apply to
commands such as "cc" and "ld". Since prefixed cross compiler names tend
to look like "armv5l-cc" this prefix tends to end with a dash.

  $ mkroot/mkroot.sh CROSS_COMPILE=armv5l-

If you haven't added the cross compiler to your $PATH, you can specify
a path as part of the prefix:

  $ mkroot/mkroot.sh CROSS_COMPILE=~/x86_64-linux-musl-cross/bin/x86_64-linux-musl-cross-

Don't forget the trailing dash.

Alternately, the variable $CROSS (as used in the Quick Start above) tells
mkroot to look in the "ccc" directory for a cross compiler starting with
a short name:

  $ mkroot/mkroot.sh CROSS=s390x

That would look (using wildcards) for ccc/s390x-*cross/bin/s390x*-cc and
if found, work out the appropriate $CROSS_COMPILER prefix to use for the
corresponding other tools. Use "CROSS=help" to see the list of cross compilers
currently available in the ccc directory.

You only need to set one of $CROSS or $CROSS_COMPILE, the other gets derived
from the one you provided.

The downloadable toolchains were built with toybox's scripts/mcm-buildall.sh
running in a fresh checkout of https://github.com/richfelker/musl-cross-make
and are available as prebuilt binaries from https://landley.net/bin/toolchains
(The "native" compilers run _on_ the target system, as well as producing
binaries for them. Those are packaged as squashfs filesystems, to be loopback
mounted within qemu.)

--- Adding a kernel

On the mkroot command line add LINUX= pointing to a kernel source directory:

  $ mkroot/mkroot.sh CROSS=sh4 LINUX=~/linux

This will build a kernel for the appropriate target, package the filesystem
as cpio.gz for use by initramfs, and create a run-qemu.sh script to invoke
qemu. This results in the following files under root/$CROSS:

  initramfs.cpio.gz - the "fs" dir packaged for initramfs, plus any $MODULES
  linux-kernel      - the compiled kernel
  linux.dtb         - The device tree binary (if this target requires one)
  run-qemu.sh       - the qemu invocation to run it all

And also:

  fs/               - the generated root filesystem (you can chroot here)
  docs/             - Additional information not needed to run qemu.

The run-qemu.sh script will connect together the appropriate -kernel, -initrd,
and -dtb arguments to consume the provided files, as well as -m board and
-append "kernel command line arguments". The KARGS environment variable is
added to the kernel command line arguments, and any additional arguments
provided to the script are passed through to qemu, so you can do:

  $ KARGS="rdinit=/bin/sh" ./run-qemu.sh -hda blah.img

Running the script should boot the kernel to a command prompt, with the
serial console connected to stdin and stdout of the qemu process so you can
just type into it and see the output. The generated kernel config should
provide basic NAT network support (as if behind a router) and block device
support.

--- Environment variables

Any "name=value" argument provided on the mkroot.sh command line will set
an environment variable, and any string without an = indicates a package
script to run before building toybox (explained below). This is why CROSS=
CROSS_COMPILE= and LINUX= were all set on the command line above.

For portability reasons, mkroot.sh clears all environment variables at the
start of its run, with the following exceptions:

LINUX         - Linux kernel source directory.
CROSS_COMPILE - Cross compiler prefix (sets $CROSS from prefix before first -)
CROSS         - Short target name (sets $CROSS_COMPILE from ccc)
HOME          - Absolute path to user's home directory.
PATH          - Executable path to find binaries.
NOCLEAR       - Don't clear environment variables. (Can't set on command line.)

Other interesting variables to set on the command line include:

NOAIRLOCK     - don't do a hermetic build, just use the $PATH's tools.
NOLOGPATH     - don't use the command line recording wrapper
NOLOG         - don't record build output to root/build/log/$CROSS.[yn]
NOTOYBOX      - don't build toybox
PENDING       - extra commands to enable out of toys/pending
KEXTRA        - Additional kernel symbols to enable (in short CSV format)
MODULES       - Kernel modules to build (in short CSV format)

--- Adding build modules

You can run additional build scripts from the mkroot/packages directory by
listing them on the command line:

  $ mkroot/mkroot.sh dropbear overlay OVERLAY=~/blah

Any "name=value" argument provided on the command line will set an environment
variable in mkroot (explained above), and any string that without an =
indicates a package script to run before building toybox.

The provided build scripts mostly download source tarballs, cross compile them,
and install them into the root filesystem. Additional package build instructions
are available from the "Linux From Scratch" (http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs)
and "Beyond Linux From Scratch" (http://linuxfromscratch.org/blfs) projects.

If you specify any packages, the "plumbing" package is automatically read first
to provide the download, setupfor, and cleanup shell functions to fetch and
manage source tarballs, and set the $DOWNLOAD variable (defaulting to store
downloaded tarballs in "./root_download").

The "overlay" script copies the $OVERLAY directory (default "./overlay")
into the root filesystem, so you can add arbitrary additional files.

The "dynamic" script attempts to copy dynamic libraries out of the
toolchain, to allow a dynamically linked root filesystem. It's a work in
progress. (A debian host toolchain can have multiple gigabytes of shared
libraries.)

The "tests" script copies the toybox test suite into the new filesystem,
downloads some test files, and adds some test modules to the kernel build.

--- Creating new build modules

Build scripts run after creating the directory layout and writing
the the init script and etc files (resolv.conf/passwd/group), but before
building toybox.

These scripts are sourced, not run, so environment variables you set remain
in force. The following variables can affect the remaining mkroot.sh build:

NOTOYBOX  - if set, toybox will not be installed into the new root filesystem
KEXTRA    - additional kernel symbols to enable (in same CSV format as $KCONF)
QEMU_MORE - Additional qemu command line arguments added to run-qemu.sh

To append instead of replacing (in case they're already set), you can use
QEMU_MORE="$QEMU_MORE --blah" and KEXTRA="${KEXTRA+$KEXTRA,}"BLAH,BLAH,BLAH

If you check your own build scripts into mkroot/packages without touching
any existing files, you should be able to "git pull --ff" to update your tree
without conflicts. Alternately, you can add your script directory to the start
of the $PATH and bash's "source" command will fall back to looking there next.
