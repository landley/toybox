    usage: chmod [-R] MODE FILE...

    Change mode of listed file[s] (recursively with -R).

    MODE can be (comma-separated) stanzas: [ugoa][+-=][rwxstXugo]

    Stanzas are applied in order: For each category (u = user,
    g = group, o = other, a = all three, if none specified default is a),
    set (+), clear (-), or copy (=), r = read, w = write, x = execute.
    s = u+s = suid, g+s = sgid, +t = sticky. (o+s ignored so a+s doesn't set +t)
    suid/sgid: execute as the user/group who owns the file.
    sticky: can't delete files you don't own out of this directory
    X = x for directories or if any category already has x set.

    Or MODE can be an octal value up to 7777	ug uuugggooo	top +
    bit 1 = o+x, bit 1<<8 = u+w, 1<<11 = g+1	sstrwxrwxrwx	bottom

    Examples:
    chmod u+w file - allow owner of "file" to write to it.
    chmod 744 file - user can read/write/execute, everyone else read only
